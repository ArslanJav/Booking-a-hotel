Practicing JavaScript using if statements and switch cases to preform the booking.

when the number of nights is 2 the output message will display the name, room and the total of two nights.

now if the number of nights is 7 but no more than 14 there will be a discount of 10% towards the total.

and if the number of nights is 14 or more there will be a 1discount of 15% added.
